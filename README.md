SQL Challenge
Module 9

Contributor: Gabriela Delgado

Overview

This project was meant to look at different CSV files and find the relationships between them, such as primary and foreign keys. This was used to look and extract the necessary data as a whole using SQL (pgadmin4).

This Challenge contains a ReadMe file, the data sets, the DBD, and the SQL files.

Git Bash

I used GitBash to download the repository to my desktop and push and commit the changes made to the Python code into the repository

Quick DBD (Data Modeling)

create a quick database diagram of the relationships between different CSV files. In this DBD I had to identify the primary and foreign keys in the data to be able to form the relationships. This was the Data Modeling part of the homework.

SQL (Data Engineering)

I used SQL first to import the DBD I created so the program would know the relationships between the datasets and then I imported the CSV files into SQL to be able to look and gather the necessary data.

SQL (Data Analysis)
This program was used to create tables with the information asked in which different tables were joined through the primary and foreign keys to access and retrieve the values of more than one table at once. Some analysis, such as frequencies and organizing, was done as well.
